Survey Analysis Summary:

- Passives: 32.5%
- Detractors: 18.0%
- Average CSAT Score: 2.96/5

Business Interpretation:
The high percentage of Promoters suggests strong brand loyalty, but the 18.0% detractor rate signals risk of churn.
Passives present a clear upsell opportunity, as they are neutral but not enthusiastic.
Improving streaming quality, adding fresh content, and optimizing pricing can convert Passives and reduce Detractors.
